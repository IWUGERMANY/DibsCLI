# Building Simulation CLI

This Python program provides a command-line interface (CLI) for simulating buildings based on data provided in a CSV or
Excel file. The program offers two main commands (`simulate_one_building` and `simulate_all_building`) to simulate
individual buildings or multiple buildings simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system. If Python is not already
installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing Python

1. Visit the [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page.
2. Choose the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and click on the download link.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" or "Add Python to
   environment variables" to ensure Python is added to your system PATH.
5. Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal and type `python --version` to verify that
   Python is installed correctly.

#### Usage

To execute the CLI, use the provided Python script `dibs_cli.py`. The program expects the path to the file containing
building data as the first argument. The remaining four arguments are optional and have default values. If the user only
provides the path argument, the program will use default values for the other arguments. If the user provides all five
arguments, the program will simulate using the user's input.

### Command `simulate_one_building`

The `simulate_one` command performs the simulation for a single building. The building data must be provided as a CSV or
Excel file and contain only one record.

### Command `simulate_all_building`

The `simulate_all` command performs the simulation for multiple buildings. The building data must be provided as a CSV
or Excel file and contain multiple records. Each record must match the same pattern and have the same number of
attributes as a building object.

### Arguments:

- `path`: Path to the file containing building data type of `str`. (Required)
- `profile_from_norm`: type of `str`. (Optional)
- `gains_from_group_values`: type of `str`. (Optional)
- `usage_from_norm`: type of `str`. (Optional)
- `weather_period`: type of `str`. (Optional)

### CSV File Format Requirements:

- The CSV or Excel file must contain a specific number of columns.
- The column names in the CSV or Excel file must match the attributes of the building object to be simulated.

### Example of Execution:

To simulate using default values for the optional arguments:

```bash
python dibs_cli.py simulate-one-building /path/to/file.csv/or/to/file.csv
```

To simulate using custom values for all arguments:

```bash
python dibs_cli.py simulate-one-building /path/to/file.csv/or/to/file.csv din18599 mid sia2024 2007-2021
```

The below command will use the default values for `--profile_from_norm`, `--usage_from_norm`, and `--weather_period`, while using
the provided value for `--gains_from_group_values`.

```bash
python dibs_cli.py simulate-one-building /path/to/file.csv/or/to/file.csv --gains_from_group_values mid
```

### Calling for Help

To get help on the available commands and options, use the `--help` flag. For example:
